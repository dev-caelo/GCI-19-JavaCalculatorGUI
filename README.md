warning: spaghetti code!

I made this during my high-school equivalent to Intro to Object Orientation Programming: AP Computer Science A (Java)
As such, the code is severely not up to standard and doesn't even implement basic OOP fundamentals. However, it was a major
starting point for my growth in coding so I can't bear myself to private it.

Nothing else here, thats it. Thanks for visiting!
